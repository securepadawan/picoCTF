# Hints

1. Maybe you have more than 2 choices
2. Check out tools like Burpsuite to modify your requests and look at the responses

# Solution

1. Using Burp Suite, turn Intercept On and click on “Choose Red” on box
2. Within Proxy, right-click “Send to Repeater”. Go to Repeater and click on Send
3. Turn Intercept Off and then back On again and click on “Choose Blue” on box
4. Within Proxy, right-click “Send to Repeater”. Go to Repeater and click on Send
5. Turn Intercept Off
6. When comparing the `Red` and `Blue` Repeater tabs, you can see the difference is on line 1. `Red` shows `GET /index.php? HTTP/1.1` and `Blue` shows `POST /index.php HTTP/1.1`
7. Modify `POST /index.php HTTP/1.1` to `HEAD /index.php HTTP/1.1` and then click “Send”. It will then export the flag
